Ti=Evidence-Based

0.sec=Does the proposal present evidence that the solution or critical components of it have previously yielded practical and concrete results? Does the evidence suggest that the solution can be adapted to other contexts, such as expanding to new populations or geographies, or to reach a greater number of people over time, and still retain its effectiveness?

Scale.Bottom=Questionable

Scale.Top=Convincing

1.Score=0.1-0.9

1.sec=Lacked evidence that the solution or any of its components have previously yielded practical, concrete results; no evidence that the solution can be adapted to other contexts.

2.Score=1.1-1.9

2.sec=Presented evidence that some components of the solution have previously worked in limited contexts; showed some signs of ability to adapt but evidence is unconvincing.

3.Score=2.1-2.9

3.sec=Established reasonable record of results for more than one component of the solution; provided a clear path towards adapting to other contexts with solid, reliable evidence.

4.Score=3.1-3.9

4.sec=Presented rigorous evidence that each of the components of the solution have worked in specific contexts; delivered compelling evidence of ability to adapt to other contexts.

5.Score=4.1-5.0

5.sec=Offered rigorous evidence that the solution has previously yielded practical and concrete results; made a strong case for adapting it to other contexts.
