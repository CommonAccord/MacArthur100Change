0.sec=Will the solution have a sustained impact? Does the solution either expect to solve a problem in five years or create a pathway to solving the problem over time?

1.Score=0.1-0.9

1.sec=Offered a solution with little to no long-term impact; presented no opportunities to elicit support from other sources; no vision for the future.

2.Score=1.1-1.9

2.sec=Offered a solution that requires continual investment for sustained impact with low probability of ongoing support from other sources; hazy vision for future.

3.Score=2.1-2.9

3.sec=Offered a solution with a well-defined pathway toward sustainability; ongoing support is possible but not assured; vision for the future is not realistic.

4.Score=3.1-3.9

4.sec=Proposed a solution with a plausible, well-defined pathway toward sustainability; ongoing support, if needed, seems probable; vision for the future is compelling and realistic.

5.Score=4.1-5.0

5.sec=Proposed an enduring solution; ongoing support, if required, is nearly guaranteed; vision for future is compelling and attainable.
